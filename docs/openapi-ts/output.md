# Output

Learn about files generated with `@hey-api/openapi-ts`.

::: tip
Your actual output depends on your Hey API configuration. It may contain a different number of files and their contents might differ.
:::

## Overview

If you use the default configuration, your [project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hey-api-example?file=openapi-ts.config.ts,src%2Fclient%2Fschemas.gen.ts,src%2Fclient%2Fsdk.gen.ts,src%2Fclient%2Ftypes.gen.ts) might look like this.

```md
my-app/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│ ├── client/
│ │ ├── index.ts
│ │ ├── sdk.gen.ts
│ │ └── types.gen.ts
│ └── index.ts
└── package.json
```

Each file is an artifact generated by a Hey API plugin. This is the default output, we will cover customizing it in this section. These files also form the base for third-party plugins.

Let's go through each file in the `src/client` folder and explain what it looks like, what it does, and how to use it.

## Index

For convenience, every artifact generated by default plugins is re-exported from `index.ts`. However, we recommend importing artifacts from their files to avoid ambiguity.

```ts
import type { Pet } from './client'; // [!code --] // 👎
import type { Pet } from './client/types.gen'; // [!code ++] // 👍
```
