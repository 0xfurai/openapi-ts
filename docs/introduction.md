# Introduction

`openapi-ts` started as a fork of [openapi-typescript-codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen). We created it after the original project became [unmaintained](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen/issues/1276#issuecomment-1302392146) to add support for OpenAPI v3.1. We plan to resolve the most pressing issues in the original project â€“ open an issue if you'd like to prioritise your use case!
